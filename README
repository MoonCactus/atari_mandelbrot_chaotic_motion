This is Atari ST / Motorola 68000 assembly that I wrote in 1991
It draws interactive Mandelbrot sets, and it compiles under 500 bytes.

It was initially part of the Phaleon Gigademo, probably one of the biggest megademo of all times.
Someone even posted a video of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zou2j1xU9iA (thanks!)

Note: the version I post here has a ton of comments, in French, because I submitted it as an article for a printed magazine I forgot all about (I think it never was published). The routine in the demo was a bit different, it included some scroller and animation around it, code to save the demo into the boot sector of floppy disks, and a syncronized raster routine to switch the palette smoothly between the images (as seen on the youtube video).
I think I lost the full source code in a serie of harddrive crashes in the beginning of this century :o

At the time our group was named Chaotic Motion, and later on Albedo 0.12 when we merged with Fashion. We coded a lot and were working on early soundtract/fullscreens but we released very few demos in fact. We naively worked way too much on our own megademo that we never released :D
